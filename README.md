# Scorpion_PDB_v1.0

I am making a Buck converter. 
I am making it using a TPS563200 Chip...I used ths because it is Small, Cheap, and Reliable to output 3A Current.

This is my schematic...I mostly referred to DataSheet of TPS563200.

This is the Layout/Routing part...I think this was the hardest part of the project, since the DataSheet gave very strict instructions for this.

Hopefully after soldering all components it look like this.

The sole purpose of the project is to power my Drone...or Future Drone : "Scorpion" ;)

Note : PDB translates to 'Power Distribution Board'

As the name suggests it will disribute power to all my Servo motors, ESC's, ESP32 (which i will be using for my Flight Controller for Scorpion) and/or any other Sensors
that I will be using in future...that's exactly why I have created 7 outputs...!

Here is the BOM of this PDB :

This is Component Part.

This is PCB Part (I am ordering from JLCPCB).
